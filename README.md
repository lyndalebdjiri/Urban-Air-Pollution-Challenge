# Urban-Air-Pollution-Challenge

This is a project from Zindi, a platform for data science competitions. The project is called "Urban Air Pollution Challenge" and it aims to predict the air quality in different cities using satellite and weather data. The motivation for this project is that air quality has a significant impact on health, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, which affects the respiratory system. However, air quality is not well monitored in many parts of Africa, where some cities have seen an increase in pollution levels due to lockdown measures. Therefore, this project seeks to use data from the Sentinel 5P satellite, which measures various atmospheric pollutants, to estimate the PM2.5 particulate matter concentration, a common indicator of air quality. The project covers the last three months and hundreds of cities across the world.
